# PulseAudio Troubleshooting and Debugging Script

This repository contains a comprehensive script designed to troubleshoot and debug PulseAudio issues on Linux systems. The script automates several checks and actions to ensure PulseAudio and ALSA are correctly configured and functioning, helping users resolve common audio problems efficiently. If your linux system is displaying 'Dummy Output' in your Audio Settings, this script shoudl fix the issue. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, I have a complete troubleshooting log offline. 

## Features

- **Installation Check:** Ensures PulseAudio and `pavucontrol` are installed.
- **Running Status Check:** Verifies if PulseAudio is running and attempts to start it if necessary.
- **ALSA Modules Check:** Confirms ALSA modules are loaded and attempts to load them if not.
- **Sound Cards Listing:** Provides a list of available sound cards.
- **Module Listing:** Lists currently loaded PulseAudio modules.
- **Module Management:** Manages the loading and unloading of PulseAudio modules.
- **Sink Listing and Default Sink Setting:** Lists available sinks and sets the default sink.
- **PulseAudio Client Connection Check:** Ensures that the PulseAudio client can connect.
- **Test Sound Playback:** Plays a test sound to verify the audio setup.
- **Detailed Logging:** Logs all steps and outputs to a file for easy troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Linux operating system
- `pulseaudio`
- `pavucontrol`

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pulseaudio-debug-script.git
   cd pulseaudio-debug-script
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x pulse_audio_debug.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   ```bash
   ./pulse_audio_debug.sh
   ```

4. **Review the Log**

   After running the script, check the `pulse_audio_debug.log` file for detailed information about the actions performed and any issues encountered.

## Script Breakdown

The script performs the following steps:

### Installation Check

Ensures that PulseAudio and `pavucontrol` are installed on the system. If they are not, the script installs them using `apt-get`.

### Running Status Check

Verifies if PulseAudio is currently running. If it is not running, the script attempts to start it. If starting PulseAudio directly fails, it tries to start it using `systemctl`.

### ALSA Modules Check

Checks if the ALSA modules are loaded. If not, the script loads the necessary modules using `modprobe`.

### Sound Cards Listing

Lists all available sound cards using `aplay -l` and logs the output.

### Module Listing

Lists all currently loaded PulseAudio modules using `pactl list short modules` and logs the output.

### Module Management

Attempts to load the ALSA sink module. If loading fails, the script unloads the existing module and retries.

### Sink Listing and Default Sink Setting

Lists all available sinks using `pactl list short sinks` and sets the default sink to the primary audio device.

### PulseAudio Client Connection Check

Verifies if the PulseAudio client can connect using `pactl info`.

### Test Sound Playback

Plays a test sound using `paplay` to ensure the audio setup is functioning correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to the `pulse_audio_debug.log` file for detailed logs of each step performed by the script. This log file can help identify what went wrong and provide insights into potential fixes.
